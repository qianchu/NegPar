# NegPar



You can find the train, test, dev files in en and zh folder. 

The files in the en/ directory come from the shared task https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/sem-shared-task-2012-resolving-scope-and-focus-negation

To experiment with projecting the English annotation to the Chinese texts, we also align the English sentences for each file (all the *.aligned.txt files in en/) with sentence indices corresponding to the ones in the Chinese corpus.
